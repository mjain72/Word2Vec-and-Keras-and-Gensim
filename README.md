# Word2Vec-and-Keras-and-Gensim
We are using a dataset published in Kaggle to decribes various dialoges spoken by the cast in a famous american sitcom - Frasier. We will first use Woer2Vec for word embedding and subsequently use it in  RNN(LSTM) model created using Keras, to predict the cast who spoke the specific dialoge. We will measure the performance using ROC_AUC matrix.
